## Introduction

This personal project is an exemple of LinearRegression for Price Prediction to discover the learning machine.
The purpose of this project is to predict the price of Bitcoin based on historical data.

In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach to modelling the relationship between a scalar response (or dependent variable) and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables).

Linear regression plays an important role in the field of artificial intelligence such as machine learning. The linear regression algorithm is one of the fundamental supervised machine-learning algorithms due to its relative simplicity and well-known properties.
